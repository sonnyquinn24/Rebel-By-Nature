# Guide for Teachers: Using GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

## What is GitHub Copilot Coding Agent?

GitHub Copilot coding agent is like having an AI programmer on your team! Instead of assigning coding tasks to human developers, you can assign them directly to Copilot. The AI will:

- Read your issue description
- Create a new branch in the repository
- Write the code to solve your request
- Create a pull request for you to review
- Respond to feedback and make improvements

## How to Request Changes

### Step 1: Create an Issue

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Choose from one of our templates:
   - **Add New Activity** - Add a new extracurricular activity
   - **Feature Enhancement** - Request new features or improvements
   - **Bug Report** - Report something that's broken
   - **Design Change** - Request visual/styling changes

### Step 2: Fill Out the Template

The templates are designed to gather all the information Copilot needs. Be as specific as possible:

- **Clear descriptions** - Explain exactly what you want
- **Specific details** - Include names, colors, schedules, etc.
- **Acceptance criteria** - How will you know it's done correctly?

### Step 3: Copilot Gets to Work

Once you create the issue:
- Copilot will automatically be assigned (👀 reaction appears)
- Copilot creates a branch and pull request
- You'll see updates in the pull request comments
- Copilot will mention you when work is complete

### Step 4: Review and Provide Feedback

When Copilot finishes:
1. Check the pull request to see the changes
2. Test the website to make sure it works as expected
3. Leave feedback if something needs adjustment
4. Approve and merge when satisfied

## Tips for Success

### Writing Good Issue Descriptions

✅ **Good Example:**
> Add a new activity called "Manga Maniacs" for students interested in Japanese graphic novels. It meets Tuesdays at 7pm in the Library, with a maximum of 15 students. Category: Arts.

❌ **Poor Example:**
> Add manga club

### Being Specific

- Include exact text, colors, or numbers
- Mention specific pages or sections of the website
- Provide examples when possible
- Explain the "why" behind your request

### Common Requests

Here are some examples of tasks that work well with Copilot:

- Adding new activities with all details
- Changing colors to match school branding
- Adding new filters or search options
- Fixing broken buttons or links
- Updating text or descriptions
- Adding new categories or features

## What to Expect

### Timeline
- Simple changes: Usually complete within hours
- Complex features: May take longer and require more feedback
- Copilot works 24/7, no need to wait for business hours!

### Communication
- Copilot will update you via pull request comments
- You can ask questions or provide feedback anytime
- Be patient - complex requests may need multiple iterations

### Quality
- Copilot follows coding best practices
- Changes are tested before being presented
- All work is done in separate branches (safe!)
- You have final approval before anything goes live

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about something:
1. Start with a simple request to learn the process
2. Look at closed issues to see examples
3. Ask for help in the issue comments
4. Remember: you can always provide feedback and ask for changes!

## Safety and Security

- Only teachers with repository access can create issues
- All changes must be reviewed and approved before going live
- Copilot can only modify the website code, nothing else
- Everything is tracked and reversible
